# RPAL Interpreter

This project implements a lexical analyzer, parser, and interpreter for the RPAL language. The interpreter produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for a given RPAL program and can further convert it into a standardized tree (ST). It also includes a Control Stack Execution (CSE) machine for program execution.

## Project Overview

The RPAL interpreter was developed in Python and consists of the following core components:

1. **myrpal.py**  
   The main entry point of the RPAL interpreter. It coordinates interactions between the lexical analyzer, parser, standardizer, and the CSE machine, orchestrating the entire execution flow.

2. **LexicalAnalyzer.py**  
   This module scans the input RPAL program to extract tokens sequentially. It includes methods like `get_identifier()`, `get_integer()`, `get_operator()`, and `get_string()` to identify and extract different token types. Any unexpected characters are flagged as errors, and the extracted tokens are returned as a list for further processing.

3. **parser.py**  
   This module processes the list of tokens generated by the lexical analyzer and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The AST can be visualized or saved for further analysis.

4. **Standardizer.py**  
   This module standardizes the AST produced by the parser. Standardization involves applying specific transformation rules to convert the AST into a canonical form, known as a standardized tree (ST).

5. **environment.py**  
   This module implements an environment for storing variable bindings. It efficiently manages variable lookups and scoping mechanisms within a hierarchical structure, which is essential for interpreting or compiling the RPAL language.

6. **cse_machine.py**  
   This module evaluates the standardized tree (ST) using a Control Stack Machine (CSE machine). It interprets control structures derived from the syntax tree and manipulates operands based on predefined rules.

## Features

- **AST Generation**: Generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from RPAL source code.
- **Standardization**: Converts the AST into a standardized tree (ST) using predefined rules.
- **Control Stack Execution**: Executes the RPAL program by interpreting the standardized tree with a CSE machine.
- **Command-Line Options**: Supports switching between modes with or without displaying the AST using `-ast`.
