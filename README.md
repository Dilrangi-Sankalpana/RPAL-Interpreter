# RPAL-Interpreter
The project requirement was to implement a lexical analyzer and a parser 
for the RPAL language. The output of the parser should be the Abstract Syntax 
Tree (AST) for the given input program. Then an algorithm must be implemented 
to convert the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into a standardized tree (ST) and the 
CSE machine should be implemented. The program should be able to read an 
input file that contains an RPAL program and switch between with -ast and 
without -ast
